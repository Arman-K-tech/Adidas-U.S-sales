# Adidas-U.S-sales
This project aims to build a dynamic Power BI dashboard for Adidas, visualizing U.S. sales  performance at a granular level. 

 Background: Adidas currently lacks a unified and insightful view into its U.S. sales 
performance—especially with key profitability metrics—across multiple dimensions 
such as geography, product, and sales channels.

 Objective: Create a robust Power BI dashboard that enables stakeholders to explore 
sales performance by retailer, region, city, product, and sales method, while also 
monitoring profitability through Total Sales, Operating Profit, and Operating Margin. 

 Scope: Focus on Adidas U.S. sales, analyzing data by retailer and geographical 
segments (Region, State, City), product categories, and sales method (e.g., 
wholesale, direct-to-consumer).
